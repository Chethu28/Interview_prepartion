# 📬 Amazon SQS & SNS – DevOps & Interview-Ready Guide

---

## 📌 What Are SQS and SNS?

| Service | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **SQS (Simple Queue Service)** | A fully managed message queue that decouples microservices, supports **message durability**, **visibility timeout**, **DLQs**, **FIFO** |
| **SNS (Simple Notification Service)** | A pub/sub (publish-subscribe) messaging service for **fan-out**, **alerts**, and **real-time notifications** |

## 🔄 Key Differences

| Feature             | SQS                          | SNS                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Type               | Message queue                | Pub/Sub notification         |
| Consumer pattern   | Polling                      | Push                         |
| Persistence        | Messages stored till read    | Messages delivered instantly |
| Retry Support      | Built-in DLQ                 | Retry policy (exponential)   |
| Ordering           | FIFO queue supported         | No order guarantee           |
| Use Case           | Decoupling services           | Alerts, event broadcasting   |

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### ✅ SQS Use Cases

- Decouple services in **microservices architecture**
- Queue background jobs (e.g., image processing, reports)
- Buffer write-heavy systems (e.g., bursty order ingestion)
- Retry mechanism with **DLQs** (Dead Letter Queues)
- Rate-limiting consumers

### ✅ SNS Use Cases

- Fan-out to **multiple services** (e.g., Lambda, SQS, email, HTTP)
- Monitoring alerts from CloudWatch → SNS → Email/SMS
- Application events to notify **multiple consumers**
- Mobile push notifications

---

## 🔗 Integration Patterns

### 🛠 EC2 / ECS / Lambda Polling from SQS

- Use **long polling** to reduce API costs  
- EC2 apps must manage polling/ack logic  
- ECS/Lambda can auto-poll and batch process messages

### 🧩 EKS with SQS

- Use **kube2iam or IRSA** to allow pods to call SQS  
- SDK-based polling with message visibility timeout

### 🔁 SNS + SQS Fan-Out

- SNS Topic publishes to **multiple SQS queues**  
- Each consumer handles messages independently  
- Use DLQ per queue for isolation

---

## 🔐 Security & IAM Best Practices

- Use **least privilege** IAM policies (`sqs:SendMessage`, `sns:Publish`, etc.)
- Restrict **SNS topic policies** to specific publishers/subscribers  
- Use **KMS encryption** for messages at rest (both SQS and SNS support it)

---

## 🧪 Real-World Scenarios – Root Cause & Fix

---

### ✅ Scenario 1: Messages Disappearing in SQS  
**Root Cause:** Consumer doesn't delete messages after processing.  
**Fix:**  
- Explicitly call `DeleteMessage` after successful processing  
- Tune **visibility timeout** correctly

---

### ✅ Scenario 2: Duplicate Message Processing  
**Root Cause:** Short visibility timeout; message retried before process completes  
**Fix:**  
- Increase **visibility timeout**  
- Use **FIFO queue** with deduplication ID

---

### ✅ Scenario 3: SNS to Lambda Invocation Fails  
**Root Cause:** Lambda lacks permission to be invoked by SNS  
**Fix:**  
- Add `sns.amazonaws.com` as **trusted principal** in Lambda's resource policy  
- Use `AddPermission` or configure via console

---

### ✅ Scenario 4: SNS Fan-out Works for One Queue Only  
**Root Cause:** Other queues don't have proper **subscription confirmation**  
**Fix:**  
- Confirm each subscription  
- Check **SNS topic access policy** allows publish to each target

---

### ✅ Scenario 5: High SQS Polling Costs  
**Root Cause:** Using **short polling** too frequently  
**Fix:**  
- Enable **long polling** (up to 20 seconds)  
- Batch requests (up to 10 messages/request)

---

## 🛡️ Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

- Capture **failed messages** for later inspection  
- Use DLQ in SQS when message exceeds maxReceiveCount  
- In SNS, configure **DLQ via subscription's redrive policy**

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Metrics (CloudWatch)

| Metric                   | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `NumberOfMessagesSent`   | How many messages published |
| `NumberOfMessagesReceived` | Processed messages |
| `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` | Delay in processing |
| `NumberOfMessagesDeleted` | Confirmed consumption |
| `DLQ` metrics             | Tracks failed deliveries |

---

## 💡 Best Practices

- Enable **message encryption (KMS)**  
- Use **FIFO queues** when order and deduplication matter  
- Set appropriate **retention period** (up to 14 days)  
- Use **DLQs** to isolate and debug failed messages  
- Avoid tight polling loops → prefer long polling  
- Monitor **queue age** and backlog regularly

## 🧠 Interview Questions & Answers

---

### Q1: How do SQS and SNS differ in architecture?
**A:**  
- SQS is pull-based, durable queue  
- SNS is push-based pub/sub system  
- SQS decouples services, SNS fans out messages to multiple endpoints

---

### Q2: How can SQS handle message retries and failures?
**A:**  
- Use **Visibility Timeout** for retry window  
- **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** captures messages that fail multiple times

---

### Q3: How to guarantee order in SQS?
**A:**  
- Use **FIFO queue**  
- Set `MessageGroupId` to group related messages  
- Enable **content-based deduplication**

---

### Q4: Can you explain SNS to SQS fan-out architecture?
**A:**  
- SNS topic publishes messages to multiple SQS queues  
- Each queue can have separate consumers  
- Each subscriber must confirm the subscription

---

### Q5: How do you scale a message processing system?
**A:**  
- Use SQS with auto-scaling Lambda or ECS consumers  
- Monitor queue depth and age  
- Tune batch size and concurrency  
- Use **DLQ and retry logic** for fault isolation

---

### Q6: How does Lambda handle messages from SQS?
**A:**  
- Lambda polls SQS on your behalf  
- Can batch up to 10 messages  
- Deletes messages automatically on success  
- On failure, can send to DLQ or retry per retry policy
